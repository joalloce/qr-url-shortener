## Node.js Application for URL Shortening and QR Code Generation

This is an example Node.js application that allows users to create short URLs and generate QR codes for a given text input. Here is a breakdown of the code:

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required and are imported at the top of the file:

- `express`: a popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
- `sharp`: a Node.js package that allows you to manipulate images.
- `QRCode`: a package that generates QR codes.
- `uniqid`: a package that generates unique IDs.
- `valid-url`: a package that validates URLs.

### Server Setup

An instance of the Express app is created and the port number is set to `5000`.

### URL Shortening

A `Map` is created to store the short URL IDs and their corresponding long URLs.

The `express.json()` middleware is used to parse JSON request bodies.

A route is defined for the `/urlshorten` endpoint. It takes a URL as input, generates a unique ID for it, stores the ID and URL in the `urlMap`, and returns the shortened URL.

### Handling Short URL Requests

A route is defined for handling short URL requests (`/:id`). It takes the short URL ID as input, looks up the corresponding long URL in the `urlMap`, and redirects the user to the long URL. If the short URL ID is not found in the `urlMap`, it returns a 404 error.

### QR Code Generation

A route is defined for generating QR codes (`/qrcode`). It takes a text input as input, generates a QR code using the `QRCode` package, and converts the QR code to a PNG image using the `sharp` package. It then sends the PNG image as a response with the appropriate content type.

### Server Startup

Finally, the app listens on the specified port and logs a message when the server is started.
